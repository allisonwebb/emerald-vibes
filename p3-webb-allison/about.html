      <h2>Becoming Mommy</h2>

      <p>Without a doubt becoming a mommy is the best thing that’s ever happened to me and at the same time the hardest change initially. Postpartum is NO joke and it affects everyone woman different. I gave myself a lot of grace and reached out for help when I needed it, you can’t overstate how much those frozen meals and meal trains mean. Watching my baby boy grow over the last year and a half has been an amazing journey! It took some time but developing into this role of mama has made me incredibly humble and grateful! This little boy keeps me on my toes and gives me SO much joy, joy that I’ve never know! </p>

      <h3>Emmett James</h3>
      <p>Emmett is a boy through and through; from dump trucks to trains, he just innately loves it. He is stubborn, joyful, curious, and silly. He is such a little lovebug! He was an unsettled newborn but has steadily developer his little personality. We can’t wait for what is to come, but try to enjoy each day!</p>

      <h4>Our Hero, Daddy</h4>
      <p>Jordan and I were married 7 years and have been together for 15. If you’re doing the math yes, we are high school sweethearts. He is a pilot in the Air Force and an amazing leader. He’s always been my best friend and a great husband but watching him become daddy makes me prouder than I’ve ever been. He is attentive and loving; he loves that little boy with is whole heart. </p>
